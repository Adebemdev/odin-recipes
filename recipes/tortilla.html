    <h2>Simple Tortialla Espanola Recipe</h2>
    <p>Tortilla Espa√±ola is a potato and onion omelette. It's a classic tapas dish, 
        prepared all over Spain. This version also includes roasted red peppers and 
        Spanish Serrano ham. Unlike most omelettes, a Spanish tortilla is served at room temperature.

    <h3>
      Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Heat 1/2 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add 1/2 of the potato slices, and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion rings, and gently cook until soft and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Spoon onions onto a plate, and allow to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in cooled onions, roasted peppers, and serrano ham. Gently fold in cooked potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the large skillet with reserved oil over low heat. Pour in egg mixture, and gently cook until the sides have started to set and the bottom has turned golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Loosen tortilla with a spatula if needed, then carefully slide onto a large plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slide the tortilla onto a serving plate and allow to cool to room temperature. Cut into six wedges and sprinkle with parsley to serve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
